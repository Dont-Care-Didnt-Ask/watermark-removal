# Watermark removal

**Final project for Skoltech Intro-to-CV-2022 course.**

**Team members:** Sushko Nikita, Seleznyov Mikhail.

## Goal
Implement and compare several approaches for watermark removal, using classical CV instruments.
In our project we focus on detecting the location of watermarks, and use standard functions for inpaiting.

## Results
We have tried
1. Pattern matching
2. SIFT intersection
3. SIFT clusterization
4. Median gradient

For detailed description of these methods and their comparison check the presentation.
